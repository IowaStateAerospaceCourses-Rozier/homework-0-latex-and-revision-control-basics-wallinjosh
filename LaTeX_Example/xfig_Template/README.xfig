Here is how to include LaTeX in figures drawn using xfig.

1) Create an xfig drawing.  Put the LaTeX math in normal text blocks, in $$'s 
just as you would in LaTeX. Make sure your "Special Flag" is set to "Special" 
on every text block that includes LaTeX. 

2) Save figure (.fig). Then Export as "Combined PS/LaTeX (both parts). This will create two files: .pstex_t, .pstex. 

3) Run run_driver.tex via the script run_driver.tcsh. This produces a .pdf that can be included in a LaTeX document.
