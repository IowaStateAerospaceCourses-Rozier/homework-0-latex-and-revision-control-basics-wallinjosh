# A brief overview of the Git workflow

Git is a tool that supports collaboration on projects, both large and small, as
it enables teams to track and merge changes on ASCII text files (e.g. code).

## Git

The highest unit of division for a single project is what Git deems a *repository* ("repo").
In creating a repo, users use the `git init` command.
